# Xpipe3
A X-ray Chandra Code for Galaxy Clusters

The code has three operational modes pre-process, imaging, analysis. The two last modes are depedent from files that comes from the previous modes.

## Pre-process
This is the first stage, it has 3 options:
1 - Download a chandra X-ray Observation
2 - Reprocess the data for level 2
3 - Clean flares

## Imaging
In this stage, it generates:
1 - corrected exposure images in a given energy band
2 - exposure maps
3 - background images (using blank-field observations)
4 - point sources

## Analysis
This is the scientific stage, here, we compute some imporant phsyical parameters of the IntraClusterMedium (ICM) such as temperature, gass mass, mass, center position, dynamical state(w,csb).


Under construction. Currently, all the notes and codes are a complete mess. It'll be ready in the near future.
